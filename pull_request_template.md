Update test_allFileMetadata.py
Hereâ€™s a concise analysis of the code:

1. **Hardcoded Path for Non-Existent File**:
   - The test for a non-existent file uses a fixed path, which can lead to issues if the environment changes. Using a dynamic path (like `tmp_path`) ensures portability across platforms.

2. **Assertion Enhancements**:
   - The test for an existing file asserts `modification_time > 0`, assuming a positive timestamp indicates a valid file. However, adding an `isinstance` check ensures the return type matches expectations, enhancing robustness.

3. **Error Handling Expectations**:
   - The `test_get_modification_time_non_existing_file` expects `-1` for non-existent files. This assumption should be confirmed by the `AllFileMetadata` class to ensure consistent handling of errors without throwing exceptions.

4. **Improved Descriptions**:
   - Slightly refining docstrings would clarify the intent of each test, making the code easier to understand and maintain.

These adjustments will make the tests more reliable, readable, and adaptable to different environments.
